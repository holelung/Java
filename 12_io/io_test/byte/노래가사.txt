[HOME SWEET HOME]

You say, It’s changed
Show must go on, Behave
오랜만에 옛 노래해
I’m feelin’ like I never left
(That’s right) I never left

But you ain’t know, O.K then lights camera, Act like you know
Don’t play on me no we’re
Air B&B, You’re ‘Home-less’
혼비백산-해진-미-장센 (mise-en-scène)
도레미파시도 (Now you know it)

두껍아 두껍아 Came with the troops
뜯고 맛보고 즐기고 big bang when I shoot
‘King’ in the Zoo, He gotta do what I do
1 of 1, not of them (mirror)
Man in the ‘Views’ Aimin’ at you?!
Yea, I’m aiming at a man & Amen achoo
Bless you all ‘Cleaned house’ Foo

Golden days are still alive
외롭다는 말하지 마
내가 있는 곳, 네가 있을 곳

The place that I belong

HOME SWEET HOME
HOME SICK HOME
Well I said, I would be back
And I’d never let you go
Pick a petal off a flower
Daze you love me Nope?
Well I said, I would be back
And I’d never let you go
Pick a petal off a flower
Do you love me or (STOP!)

Winner winner chicken killer, 삼계탕 dinner
하나 둘 set down (1, 2 step) ‘Fantastic’한 팀워크
Not mini, 많이. ‘More’
Rock, scissors, paper. ‘Toast’
This is how we do it just do it let’s do it y’all

Work- work- 월화수목금토- 일
They gon’ wait til’ I’m gone
So I came, I saw, I won
‘G just D’ Word is my bond

나 무대로 올라, Coup d’e shh
단숨에 호흡곤란, Hook catch this
아 ‘무제’ 도 몰라? Bull as shh
Whatever?! ‘Now or Never’

Golden days are still alive
외롭다는 말하지 마
네가 있을 곳에 내가 있는 걸

The place that I belong

HOME SWEET HOME
HOME SICK HOME
Well I said, I would be back
And I’d never let you go
Pick a petal off a flower
Daze you love me Nope?
Well I said, I would be back
And I’d never let you go
Pick a petal off a flower
Do you love me or (STOP!)

We alike dead or alive, Your life? Still-life
It’s so nice, I missed u a lot, You’re welcome Back home, Wherever you are
We alike dead or alive, Your life is still with me Livin’ good-life, Day or Nights,
The high-light, It’s about time to ‘ROCK-ON’

HOME SWEET HOME
HOME SICK HOME
Well I said, I would be back
And I’d never let you go
Pick a petal off a flower
Daze you love me Nope?
Well I said, I would be back
And I’d never let you go
Pick a petal off a flower
Do you love me or (STOP!)
